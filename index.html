        <h2>Post Mortem</h2>
        <p class="post-mortem-paragraph">
            In this paragraph, we describe how we would further develop the project if given more time. 
            For this project, if we had additional time, we would have incorporated more features into the game engine and the tool, including more functionality and better use experience. 
            For instance, we could have made the tilemap editor more user-friendly by adding a button to delete cells or implementing a zoom in/out feature.
            For the game engine, we would have liked to add a GUI system, enabling game developers to easily incorporate GUI elements into their games. 
            As for the game itself, we would have expanded it with more levels and a greater variety of enemies.
            
            Moreover, we would like to add a new component: a particle system. This addition would significantly enhance the game's visual effects and create a more immersive experience for players. One specific implementation of the particle system would be to create a fireball effect. The fireball is a classic element in the Super Mario series, allowing Mario to throw balls of fire at enemies, and its inclusion would provide an additional layer of complexity and fun to the gameplay. To achieve this, we would design and develop custom particle emitters to generate the fireball's appearance and physics, as well as handle its interactions with the game world and its various elements, such as enemies and destructible objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this paragraph, we describe what went well during the project development. 
            About The technical part, we took time in designing and improving the architecture, structure and data-driven approach and game object with component pattern. It worked well during implementation phase as new components/ are easier to be inserted into a structured system.
            Teamwork wise, there are also several things that were great during the development. 
            Firstly, we had great communication and collboration when making design decision, distributing implementation tasks, and supporting each other in the team when testing and adjusting. In this well-organized collaboration, we had high efficiency delivering code and testing. 
            Secondly, we endeavored a lot to realize our planned items, and we tried our best to explore and handle new or unfamiliar techniques. During the development, we balanced flexibility and persistency to reach the goal of completing the tasks in the given time.
            Thirdly, we used many perspectives during the development, such as software engineers' mindset, game designers' mindset and gameplayers' perspective to make sure we create good game engine, tilemap editor tool, and sameple game. We were motivated to always improve our code and take care of the details to make sure users have better experience using our game enine and tilemap editor and playing our game.
            
        </p>

            In this paragraph, we describe what we would change if given another month to work on the project.
